<p>
nexTM is a threat modeling tool tailored towards agile software development. It provides a clean and easy to use model editor which is loosely inspired by <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon">OWASP Threat Dragon</a> (as it also makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/antvis/X6">antvis X6</a> library). Besides the model editor, nexTM allows you to structure your threat modeling projects into products, product increments, and models to conveniently keep track of any changes  throughout application development. In the near future, it is planned to implement a "diff view" feature to highlight model changes between different increments. More coming soon...

This project uses the <a href="https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate">Electron React Boilerplate.</a>
